# Group-Time Average Treatment Effects
# Description
# att_gt computes average treatment effects in DID setups where there are more than two periods of
# data and allowing for treatment to occur at different points in time and allowing for treatment effect
# heterogeneity and dynamics. See Callaway and Santâ€™Anna (2021) for a detailed description
