# CHAS-capstone
1. In terminal, run `git clone` followed by link to the repository `git@github.com:mbi6245/CHAS-capstone.git`, can also be found from the green "Code" dropdown menu
1. Add any new files of yours (e.g. data_cleaning.Rmd), as well as the data csv files, to the folder created by the `git clone` command
  1. No need to worry about the .csv files possibly being tracked by git/being pushed up to GitHub. As long as you don't modify the `.gitignore` file, this will not happen
